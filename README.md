# Description:

Given the dot file (attached), please create visualizations as below:

1. Node gradient coloring based on frequency.
2. Edges in the most frequent path followed must have a different color.
3. Nodes involved in the most frequent path in a different shape.
4. Edge thickness based on frequency of the edge used.

Bonus points for:

1. clickable nodes => For example, (clicking on the node opens a new tab that says, you have just clicked `<nodename>`).
2. Dockerize the application
